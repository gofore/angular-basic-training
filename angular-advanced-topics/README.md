# Router
- Core responsibilities:
  - Map URL into app state
  - Provide transitions from one URL to another (state to another)
- Supports lazy loading of certain paths

---

# Router - Basics
Route declarations

_app.module.ts_
```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
*import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

*const routeConfig = [
*  {
*    path: 'todos',
*    component: TodosComponent
*  }
*];

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent, TodosComponent, TodoItemComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
*   RouterModule.forRoot(routeConfig),
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

---

# Router - Basics
`<router-outlet></router-outlet>` declares the placeholder for routed component tree

_app.component.html_
```html
<h1>App works!</h1>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

---

# Router - More advanced routes

_app.module.ts_
```typescript
const routeConfig = [
  {
    path: 'todos',
*   children: [
*     {
*       path: '',
*       component: TodosComponent
*     },
*     {
*       path: ':index',
*       component: EditTodoItemComponent
*     }
*   ]
  }
];
```

declares routes `todos/` and `todos/:id`. `:id` is named placeholder for path parameter that can be accessed within the component.

---

# Router - Redirects
- By default matching of URLs is done with _startsWith_ algorithm
- `pathMatch: 'full'` can be used to set the algorithm to full matching
- Redirects can be done with `redirectTo`

_app.module.ts_
```typescript
const routeConfig = [
  {
*   path: ''
*   pathMatch: 'full',
*   redirectTo: 'todos/'
  },
  {
    path: 'todos',
    component: TodosComponent
  }
];
```
---

# Router - Accessing Route Parameters
- Route parameters can be accessed via `ActivedRoutes` instances `params` value as observable.
- Every time the parameters change, new event will be sent.
- Makes it possible not to load the component again and again from scratch

```typescript
@Component({})
export class EditTodoItemComponent {
  constructor(route: ActivatedRoute) {
    route.params.subscribe((params) => {
      this.index = +params['index']; // + converts string to number in JavaScript
    });
  }
```

---

# Router - Fragments & Query Parameters
- Fragments (`example.com#key=value`) and query parameters (`example.com?key=value`) are shared by all routes
- Can be accessed just like path parameters:

```typescript
@Component({})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(route: ActivatedRoute) {
    route.queryParams.subscribe((params) => { // or .fragment
      this.key = +params['key'];
    });
  }
```

---

# Router - Navigating
- Two ways to navigate between states:
 - Imperatively from within the components code: `this.router.navigateByUrl('todos/1')` or `this.router.navigate(['todos', 1])`
 - Declaratively from within the template: `<div [routerLink]=['todos', 1]>`
- URLs starting with `/` are absolute navigations, others relative
- `../` also works for accessing the "parent" URL

_app.component.ts_
```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(`private router: Router`) {
*   this.router.navigate(['todos']);
  }
}
```

_app.component.html_
```html
<a [routerLink]="['todos', 3]">
  Todo 3
</a>
```

---

# Router - Guards
- Multiple guards available for each route:
  - `CanActivate` to mediate navigation to a route
  - `CanActivateChild` to mediate navigation to a child route
  - `CanDeactivate` to mediate navigation away from the current route
  - `Resolve` to perform route data retrieval before route activation
  - `CanLoad` to mediate navigation to a feature module loaded asynchronously
- The `Can*` guards can return either boolean or promise (resolving to a boolean value) to allow or prevent navigation

---
# Router - Guards
- Usage:

_app.module.ts_
```typescript
const routeConfig = [
  {
    path: 'todos',
*   canActivate: [AuthGuard],
    component: TodosComponent
  }
];
```

_auth-guard.ts_
```typescript
import { CanActivate, Router,
  ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot } from '@angular/router';

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private router: Router, private authService: AuthService) {}

  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): boolean {
    return this.authService.checkLogin(state.url);
  }
```

---

# Router - URL Strategies
- Two strategies for URL formation:
  - `PathLocationStrategy`: HTML5 _pushState_ style (`example.com/todos/1`) (default)
  - `HashLocationStrategy`: Hash URLs (`example.com/#/todos/1`)
- Setting the strategy:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot(routeConfig, `{ useHash: true }`)
  ],
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

---

# Pipes
- Simple display-value transformations
- Similar concept as _filters_ in AngularJS
- Angular provides few common ones, e.g.: `UpperCasePipe`, `LowerCasePipe` and `DatePipe`

_my.component.html_
```html
<div>{{user.name` | uppercase`}}</div> <!-- JOHN DOE -->
```

_my.component.ts_
```typescript
import {UpperCasePipe} from '@angular/common';

@Component({
* pipes: [UpperCasePipe]
})
class MyComponent {}
```

---

# Pipe arguments

```html
<div>{{user.birthDay | date`:'fullDate'`}}</div> <!-- Friday, April 15, 1988 -->
```

---

# Multiple pipes
- Pipes can be piped (like in UNIX)

```html
<div>{{user.birthDay` | date:'fullDate' | uppercase`}}</div> <!-- FRIDAY, APRIL 15, 1988 -->
```

---

# Custom Pipes
- Declared with `@Pipe` annotation
- `PipeTransform` interface with `transform` method
- `transform` takes the value as first argument and the optional arguments as rest of parameters
- Must be declared in `NgModule` declaration to be available in templates

```typescript
import {Pipe, PipeTransform} from '@angular/core';

*@Pipe({name: 'exponential'})
*export class ExponentialPipe implements PipeTransform {
*  transform(value: number, exponent: string): number {
    let exp = parseFloat(exponent);
    return Math.pow(value, isNaN(exp) ? 1 : exp);
  }
}
```

```html
<div>{{10 | exponential:3}}</div> <!-- 1000 -->
```

---

# Forms
- Angular provides common form functionalities:
  - Two-way data binding
  - Change tracking
  - Validation
  - Error handling
- Angular forms can be either model- or template-driven
  - Only template-driven forms are covered here, as they are enough for most use cases
- To enable forms, we need to add `FormsModule` to imports of our `NgModule`:

```typescript
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
*   FormsModule
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

---

# Forms - Template-driven Forms
- Forms declared in templates rather than in component
- Each input inside form element is attached by default
- Each input needs to have (unique) name attribute set

```html
<form>
  <input type="text" name="name" [(ngModel)]="name" />
  <input type="email" name="email" [(ngModel)]="email" />
<form>
```

---

# Forms - Using Template-local Variables
Forms export `FormControl` as `ngModel` for each input to be bound to template-local variable

```html
<form>
  <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name" `name="name"` `#nameModel="ngModel"` required />
  <input type="email" [(ngModel)]="email" `name="email"` `#emailModel="ngModel"` required />
  <span [hidden]="`nameModel.valid && emailModel.valid`">
    We have an invalid input.
  </span>
<form>
```
(`#nameModel` and `#emailModel` are called template-local variables)

---

# Forms - CSS Classes
- CSS classes are attached automatically by framework

![Control CSS Classes](angular-advanced-topics/control-css-classes.png "Control CSS Classes")

```css
.ng-invalid[required] {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```

---

# Forms - NgForm
- Forms exports `ngForm` which can be bound into template-local variable
- Contains combined information about all the input controls inside the form

```html
<form `#myForm="ngForm" (submit)="submitForm(myForm)"`>
  <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name" name="name" #name="ngModel" />
  <input type="email" [(ngModel)]="email" name="email" #email="ngModel" />

  <button type="submit" `[disabled]="myForm.invalid"`>Submit</button>
<form>
```

---

# Forms - Accessing Form Inside Component
- Template-driven forms can be accessed from component with `@ViewChild('myForm')` annotation:

```typescript
import { ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';

@Component(..)
export class MyComponent {
  @ViewChild('myForm')
  private myForm: FormGroup;
}
```

---

# Dependency Injection
- Dependency Injection (DI) is a common pattern in modern frameworks to provide component with its dependencies
- Using DI the component can just rely on the dependencies to be provided for it
- Makes components easier to test, more solid and flexible

---

# Dependency Injection in Angular
The root dependency injector is created for root component (`AppComponent` in this case) with `bootstrap` method

```TypeScript
bootstrap(AppComponent);
```
`bootstrap` also accepts another parameter, which is an array of providers that would be registered:

```TypeScript
bootstrap(AppComponent, `[UserService, BackendService]`);
```
The providers would be now injectable to anywhere and also singleton within the whole application.
This is discouraged as the providers should be registered only where needed with `providers` metadata like

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'users',
* providers: [UserService]
})
export class UsersComponent { }
```
This way the `UserService` would now be injectable to any child component of this component and not in whole application scope

---

# Directives
- There are three kinds of directives in Angular:
  - Components, which are basically selectors with templates and inputs and outputs
  - Structural directives, `ngFor` and `ngIf` are examples of these
  - Attribute directives
- Here we talk about attribute directives which can be used to decorate the elements

---

# Directives - Example
-  A directive for setting background color to yellow

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef, Input } from '@angular/core';
@Directive({
    selector: '[myHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
    constructor(el: ElementRef) {
       el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
    }
}
```

```html
<span myHighlight></span>
```

---

# Directives - Events
- We can use `host` property to define events with their corresponding handlers

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef, Input } from '@angular/core';
@Directive({
    selector: '[myHighlight]',
*   host: {
*     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',
*     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'
*   }
})
export class HighlightDirective {
    private el:HTMLElement;
    constructor(el: ElementRef) { this.el = el.nativeElement; }
*   onMouseEnter() { this.highlight("yellow"); }
*   onMouseLeave() { this.highlight(null); }
    private highlight(color: string) {
      this.el.style.backgroundColor = color;
    }
}
```

---

# Directives - Bind Value from Host Component
- We can bind host components property to our directive by declaring an `@Input` annotation:

```typescript
@Input('myHighlight') highlightColor: string;
```
- Now we can pass the property like

```html
<span `[myHighlight]="color"`></span>
```

---

# Zone.js
- Implements concept of zones (inspired by Dart) in JavaScript
- "A Zone is an execution context that persists across async tasks"
- In practice makes it possible to track the asyncronous calls made (HTTP, timers and event listeners) within the zone
- Angular uses zones internally to track changes in state

---

# Change Detection - General
- Idea: project the internal state into UI (DOM in web)
- The internal state consists of JavaScript primitives such as objects, arrays, strings etc.
- Change only possible on asynchronous events such as timeouts or HTTP request

---

# Change Detection - Angular
- Zone.js makes it possible to track all possible change sources
- Components change detector checks the bindings (like `{{name}}` and `(click)`) defined in its template on change
- Bindings are propagated from the root to leaves in the depth first order
- Change detection graph is directed tree and can't contain cycles -> improved performance, predictability and debugging

---

![Change detection](angular-advanced-topics/change-detection.png "Change detection")

---
# Change Detection - Simplified Implementation
```typescript
// very simplified version of actual source
class ApplicationRef {
    changeDetectorRefs: ChangeDetectorRef[] = [];

    constructor(private zone: NgZone) {
      this.zone.onTurnDone
        .subscribe(() => this.zone.run(() => this.tick());
    }

    tick() {
      this.changeDetectorRefs
        .forEach((ref) => ref.detectChanges());
    }
}
```
---

# Change Detection - Strategies
- Change detection strategy describes which strategy will be used the next time change detection is triggered
- Angular has six change detection strategies:
  - **CheckOnce**: After calling _detectChanges_ the mode of the change detector will become _Checked_.
  - **Checked**: Change detector should be skipped until its mode changes to _CheckOnce_.
  - **CheckAlways**: After calling _detectChanges_ the mode of the change detector will remain _CheckAlways_.
  - **Detached**: Change detector sub tree is not a part of the main tree and should be skipped.
  - **OnPush**: Change detector's mode will be set to _CheckOnce_ during hydration.
  - **Default**: Change detector's mode will be set to _CheckAlways_ during hydration.
- Setting the strategy:
```typescript
@Component({`changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`})
```

---

# Change Detection - Angular Performance
- Change detection is one of the key functionalities of Angular and thus it is highly optimized
- CDs get VM optimized monomorphic classes generated for them at runtime
- Change detection is always single-pass (stable) because of uni-directional top-to-bottom flow
- More optimizations possible with _immutables_ and _observables_
